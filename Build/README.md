###The CFi Boilerplate Framework
A lightweight framework for rapid develompment of HTML5

---

The framework is designed to make CFi HTML5 developments easier. It's built
using HTML5 & has a strong semantic foundation. It was updated recently
using some of the HTML5 Boilerplate's recommended markup and setup.  
It's constantly growing so be sure to check back often if you are a
frequent user. I'm always open to contribution. :)
